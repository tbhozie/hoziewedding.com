      <description>Hi! Welcome to our wedding website. Below you can read about Tyler and Brooke. How we met, where we got engaged, as well as our party for the wedding.
How we met We met at Gorilla 76, a marketing agency here in St. Louis. Tyler loved that Brooke had a very bubbly personality and that she was a very positive person. We quickly hit it off when we started chatting on the company chat system.</description>
