Hi! Welcome to our wedding website. Below you can read about Tyler and Brooke. How we met, where we got engaged, as well as our party for the wedding.

## How we met

We met at Gorilla 76, a marketing agency here in St. Louis. Tyler loved that Brooke had a very bubbly personality and that she was a very positive person. We quickly hit it off when we started chatting on the company chat system. Don't worry we can't get in trouble, as neither of us work there still. For a while, we hid our relationship from our work because we weren't sure how everyone would feel about it. It wasn't until we were going to go on a trip together to Las Vegas (which is now our favorite place to vacation) did Brooke tell our bosses.

## Our Engagement

Brooke has always had a fascination with Europe, more specifically Ireland, and so we knew we needed to go on a trip there. So in January of 2018 we planned a trip for August 2018 to visit both Ireland and Scotland over 2 weeks with 1 week in each country.

Tyler knew this was the perfect opportunity to ask the girl he wanted to spend the rest of his life with to marry him. Brooke had always talked about one of the most important things she wanted to visit in Ireland was the Cliffs of Moher, so Tyler knew this had to be the place to do it. The day came to take the tour to the cliffs and Tyler was feeling quite under the weather, but wasn't going to let that stop him.

So we arrive at the cliffs, and Tyler is starting to feel very nervous because there is so many people around and he was going to be putting on a show. After taking in the breathtaking views at the cliffs, we got to a semi-secluded spot and Tyler knew this was the time. So, he goes to reach into his pocket to get the ring and is having some trouble getting it out of his coat pocket, by this time Brooke pretty much already knows what's happening. After some delay... Tyler is finally able to get the ring out and kneels down on one knee. Brooke says YES! and of course people stop to take videos and pictures, but it didn't matter at that point.
